<p><font size="5"> This year's 47th issue of Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine is revealing on Monday the name of the new Naruto Shippūden arc that will premiere with 
the anime's 480th episode (or 700th if you include the episode count of the original Naruto
TV anime series). The new arc is titled "Shōnen Jidai-hen" (Boyhood Arc), and it will return to Naruto's childhood days when the Nine-Tails was still sealed within him. The 480th episode will focus on Naruto and Hinata, and will air on October 20.

Anly will perform the series' new opening theme song "Kara no Kokoro" with the new arc, while the group Ayumikurikamaki will perform the ending theme song "Tabidachi no Uta" (Departure Song).

The anime recently aired an hour-long special on September 29 with episodes 476 and 477 that featured the "last battle" between Sasuke and Naruto. As of the episode that aired 
on October 6, the anime has covered up through the 698th chapter of Masashi Kishimoto's 700-chapter original manga.</p></li>

<p><font size="5"> The Grim Reaper has all of Class E in his grasp, and Irina is behaving a little strangely – is she done being the nice, albeit difficult, teacher the students have come to know? And will seeing the Grim Reaper in action help Nagisa to decide how he wants his future to go? His mother certainly has some ideas about that, and she's determined that Class E will play no part in her son's future. 
Is it time for Nagisa to move on?</p></li>
